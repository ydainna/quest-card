## Quest card SCSS

### How to use this ?

#### Requiered

1.  Node
2.  Yarn

Once the prerequisites are installed you need to clone the repo via the link
`git@github.com:ydainna/quest-card.git`

Once this is done you just have to open the project then do `yarn install` in the terminal and finally do `yarn dev` to run the script.

I wanted to use sass because I like to have the possibility to nest
